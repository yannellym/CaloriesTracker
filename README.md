Update #2

# Android Project 6 - BitFit

Submitted by: Yannelly Mercado

BitFit is a health metrics app that allows users to track their foods and calories. It displays a dash based on the foods they have eaten and its respective calories

Time spent: 30 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Use at least 2 Fragments**
- [X] **Create a new dashboard fragment where users can see a summary of their entered data**
- [X] **Use one of the Navigation UI Views (BottomNavigation, Drawer Layout, Top Bar) to move between the fragments**

* While the fragments are implemented and the navigation menu is displaying, there seems to be an error with my data display that I cannot figure out. My assumption is that somehow the data binding in my program is not working. Though I have synced, rebuilt, clearned, and refactored the code everal times.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I was able to implement the fragments and the menu navigation. However, I have faced a lot of challenges with the data. On the project, I can see that the data is being added to the database. It also searches to the database and updates correctly. it, however, does not display the data in the UI. I'm assuming this has to do with why the menu navigation bar jumps everytime we are redirected to the main page.
